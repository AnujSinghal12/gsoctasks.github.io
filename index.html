            <p>App Inventor to me feels like the perfect way to introduce students to programming because of  the intuitive nature of the medium and its open-source spirit. I believe it has a valuable and ever-increasing role in helping the creators of tomorrow, and that’s why I would love to contribute to it. 
I really like the kind of environment Scilab gives to new contributors and this has given me more incentives to contribute to Scilab, both, to its software and to its community.</p>

            <p>`useFront` property enables a user to set the front facing camera as the default camera when the camera app is launched using an application. 
This property is an undocumented feature of the android camera system. In 2014, this feature was dropped from most (not all) android devices. 
Leaving an unsupported feature in the code would have created confusion. So it was deprecated, and removed from the designer.
Since App Inventor simply launches the device’s default camera app, it cannot send any queries to the camera. It is not possible to implement the `useFront` feature because of the lack of control the application has over the camera. 
One way to fix this would be to create a camera within the applications. 
This would allow us to send a very diverse range of queries to the camera and give us access to creating properties such as `useFront`.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
          	<h4>Challenge:</h4>
            <p>App Inventor uses the device’s default camera, this means that once the application opens the camera it no longer has any control over the camera application. Therefore, it will only have the default camera features present. There would be no way to add new features in this setup.</p>
            <h4>Proposed Solution:</h4>
            <p>Build a direct access camera into App Inventor. This would mean that users could build apps that open an inbuilt camera in the application. Since we have direct access to this camera we would be able to add features to it. This is where we would implement our feature to click pictures automatically.</p>
            <h4>Automated Picture Clicking:</h4>
            <p>We will need to build a new component, let’s refer to it as `InAppCamera`.
In this component, we will implement the automated picture clicking feature, let’s call it `autoTakePicture`.</p>
			<h4>Implementation Steps:</h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>The android `CameraManager` class is used to manage all the camera devices in our android device. So in order to perform functions like list, query, and open available camera devices, we first obtain a CameraManager instance. We can use getCameraIdList() function to get the list of Camera IDs.</li>
				<li>Each camera device has a range of properties and settings that describe the device. This information is provided through the `CameraCharacteristics` object, and is available using `getCameraCharacteristics(String)`</li>
				<li>Once we have the list of cameras, we can give the user an option to select among those or we can select the default camera as a Minimal Viable Product(MVP) approach.</li>
				<li>After we have selected a camera, to capture or stream images from a camera device, the application must first create a camera capture session with `createCaptureSession(SessionConfiguration)`.</li>
				<li>The camera capture needs a surface to output what has been captured or being previewed. A target Surface can be obtained using `SurfaceView`.</li>
				<li>The application then needs to construct a CaptureRequest, which defines all the capture parameters needed by a camera device to capture a single image. The request also lists which of the configured output Surfaces should be used as targets for this capture. So we pass our previously made `SurfaceView` as a parameter to it. </li>
				<li>Once the request has been set up, it can be handed to the active capture session for an automatic capture after a predefined countdown timer. We will call this in our `autoTakePicture` method.</li>
				<li>After processing a request, the camera device will produce a TotalCaptureResult object, which contains information about the state of the camera device at the time of capture, and the final settings used.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>`InAppCamera` will have a method called `autoTakePicture` which will trigger the launch of camera and enable the user to take picture.<br/> 
There could be many different events that could trigger this function. For simplicity, let’s choose a timer to be the trigger for `autoTakePicture`. According to it, a picture gets clicked after a specified amount of time(say 3 seconds) after opening the camera.
So, when the `autoTakePicture` function is called it will open camera and click after 3 seconds of gap.
