            <p>App Inventor to me feels like the perfect way to introduce students to programming because of  the intuitive nature of the medium and its open-source spirit. I believe it has a valuable and ever-increasing role in helping the creators of tomorrow, and that’s why I would love to contribute to it.</p>

            <p>I do not have experience in teaching programming. But since I came to know about App Inventor, I’ve introduced my younger cousin to it. I taught him how to use the tools, and since then he’s been exploring it well on his own without knowing any programming languages.</p>

            <p>My proposed Summer Project is “Unified Color UI”.</p>
            <h4>Brief Abstract:</h4>
            <p>The color interface in App Inventor deals with multiple different formats, this leads to confusion for the user while switching from one part of App Inventor to the other. This project will make additions to GUI Color Picker in designer, the blocks in the color drawer, add a mechanism to detect blocks that return a color, and add an option to see the visual representation of a color in the Blocks editor. Our objective is to make a user interface for colors that solve the problems expressed by the community, one that allows the community to interact with the colors in app inventor in a more efficient, consistent, and beginner-friendly way.</p>

            <p>I have good experience with Java and specifically Object Oriented Programming with Java. It was one of my courses, it taught me how to do Java OOP software design and modular design during it. All of our Programming tests would also take place in Java. We would be given a JavaDoc and would have to create the java code for it. Therefore, I have decent experience with Java and Javadocs. <br/>
I have some experience with JavaScript too, I’ve made two(1,2) programs using it.<br/>
Most of the commits I’ve made to the App Inventor repository have also been made in Java or JavaScript code.
I’ve learned a lot about GitHub while contributing to App Inventor.
I have some experience with GWT, from my commits to the App Inventor repository.</p>

            <p>Apart from the past 3 months of experience with App Inventor Community, I’ve been a part of multiple class projects. Our team of around 10 members was asked to come up with the complete structure, design, and documentation of a software that would prove to be helpful to students in our university, as part of the Object Oriented Programming course. Due to the pandemic situation, we were all stuck in our homes, and could only communicate online. I learned how to effectively communicate and share ideas in a team online. I became more familiar with division of responsibility and the importance of merging the work done by each subteam. <br/>
I am currently working on another team project with six people. The project includes working on an old software using which we can’t share our progress and effectively collaborate, this led us to experiment with different ways of sharing our progress and code. Despite these problems, we are ahead of our schedule and have gotten good feedback from the professors.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>`useFront` property enables a user to set the front facing camera as the default camera when the camera app is launched using an application. 
This property is an undocumented feature of the android camera system. In 2014, this feature was dropped from most (not all) android devices. 
Leaving an unsupported feature in the code would have created confusion. So it was deprecated, and removed from the designer.
Since App Inventor simply launches the device’s default camera app, it cannot send any queries to the camera. It is not possible to implement the `useFront` feature because of the lack of control the application has over the camera. 
One way to fix this would be to create a camera within the applications. 
This would allow us to send a very diverse range of queries to the camera and give us access to creating properties such as `useFront`.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
          	<h4>Challenge:</h4>
            <p>App Inventor uses the device’s default camera, this means that once the application opens the camera it no longer has any control over the camera application. Therefore, it will only have the default camera features present. There would be no way to add new features in this setup.</p>
            <h4>Proposed Solution:</h4>
            <p>Build a direct access camera into App Inventor. This would mean that users could build apps that open an inbuilt camera in the application. Since we have direct access to this camera we would be able to add features to it. This is where we would implement our feature to click pictures automatically.</p>
            <h4>Automated Picture Clicking:</h4>
            <p>We will need to build a new component, let’s refer to it as `InAppCamera`.
In this component, we will implement the automated picture clicking feature, let’s call it `autoTakePicture`.</p>
			<h4>Implementation Steps:</h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>The android `CameraManager` class is used to manage all the camera devices in our android device. So in order to perform functions like list, query, and open available camera devices, we first obtain a CameraManager instance. We can use getCameraIdList() function to get the list of Camera IDs.</li>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/img1.png">
				<br/>
				<li>Each camera device has a range of properties and settings that describe the device. This information is provided through the `CameraCharacteristics` object, and is available using `getCameraCharacteristics(String)`</li>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/img2.png">
				<br/>
				<li>Once we have the list of cameras, we can give the user an option to select among those or we can select the default camera as a Minimal Viable Product(MVP) approach.</li>
				<br/>
				<li>After we have selected a camera, to capture or stream images from a camera device, the application must first create a camera capture session with `createCaptureSession(SessionConfiguration)`.</li>
				<br/>
				<li>The camera capture needs a surface to output what has been captured or being previewed. A target Surface can be obtained using `SurfaceView`.</li>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/img3.png">
				<br/>
				<li>The application then needs to construct a CaptureRequest, which defines all the capture parameters needed by a camera device to capture a single image. The request also lists which of the configured output Surfaces should be used as targets for this capture. So we pass our previously made `SurfaceView` as a parameter to it. </li>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/img4.png">
				<br/>
				<li>Once the request has been set up, it can be handed to the active capture session for an automatic capture after a predefined countdown timer. We will call this in our `autoTakePicture` method.</li>
				<br/>
				<li>After processing a request, the camera device will produce a TotalCaptureResult object, which contains information about the state of the camera device at the time of capture, and the final settings used.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>`InAppCamera` will have a method called `autoTakePicture` which will trigger the launch of camera and enable the user to take picture.<br/> 
There could be many different events that could trigger this function. For simplicity, let’s choose a timer to be the trigger for `autoTakePicture`. According to it, a picture gets clicked after a specified amount of time(say 3 seconds) after opening the camera.
So, when the `autoTakePicture` function is called it will open camera and click after 3 seconds of gap.
