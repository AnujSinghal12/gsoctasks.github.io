            <p>App Inventor to me feels like the perfect way to introduce students to programming because of  the intuitive nature of the medium and its open-source spirit. I believe it has a valuable and ever-increasing role in helping the creators of tomorrow, and that’s why I would love to contribute to it. 
I really like the kind of environment Scilab gives to new contributors and this has given me more incentives to contribute to Scilab, both, to its software and to its community.</p>

            <p>`useFront` property enables a user to set the front facing camera as the default camera when the camera app is launched using an application. 
This property is an undocumented feature of the android camera system. In 2014, this feature was dropped from most (not all) android devices. 
Leaving an unsupported feature in the code would have created confusion. So it was deprecated, and removed from the designer.
Since App Inventor simply launches the device’s default camera app, it cannot send any queries to the camera. It is not possible to implement the `useFront` feature because of the lack of control the application has over the camera. 
One way to fix this would be to create a camera within the applications. 
This would allow us to send a very diverse range of queries to the camera and give us access to creating properties such as `useFront`.</p>
